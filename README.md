# SudokU

SudokU is basically a Sudoku game where you can solve Sudoku exercises. It is a refactored version of one of my college projects.

It can create and meanwhile solve different types of exercises:
- Simple sudoku
- Sudoku-X
- Center Dot
- Killer Sudoku combined with the above ones

It supports not just generating but importing exercises from simple text files in a given format, if you e.g. stuck with one in a newspaper and you need some hint or validation help.

The application also includes some basic options for validating the cells during and after solving the exercise.

# First start

Add the following entry to your system environment variables:

```SUDOKU_PATH=<path of the cloned SudokU repository>\Sudoku```

It is for identifying the path of the config and localization files.
