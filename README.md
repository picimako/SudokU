SudokU
======

SudokU is basically a Sudoku game where you can solve Sudoku exercises. It is a hugely refactored version of one of my college projects.

It can create and meanwhile solve different types of exercises:
- Simple sudoku
- Sudoku-X
- Center Dot
- Killer Sudoku combined with the above ones

It supports not just generating but importing exercises from simple text files in a given format, if you e.g. stuck with one in a newspaper and you need some hint or validation help.

The application also includes some basic options for validating the cells during and after solving the exercise.

Future plans and todos
======================

Plans contain the following items:
- it currently has many non-English variable/method etc. names and comments, that should be changed to English
- refactor and optimize code
- remove unnecessary comments
- move forms and localization to XAML based implementation
- add unit tests
